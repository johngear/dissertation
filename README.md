# Dissertation

This is my ~10,000 word dissertation for the completion of a MSc in Philsophy of Science from the London School of Economics and Political Science.  

Formal Abstract:
As algorithmic decisions continue to play increasingly consequential roles in our lives, it is reasonable that we are offered explanations in some cases. First, then, there must be an account of algorithmic explanation to evaluate if something is an explanation, and the quality evaluated thereafter. Most accounts of explainable artificial intelligence offer a somewhat narrow view– a specific explanation type or mechanism, which by itself doesn’t seem to be a general account. I argue for a pragmatic account of explanation, based on van Fraassen’s writing. Crucially, this makes an explanation context-dependent and gives wide scope to what can be considered a good explanation depending on the context in which it is requested. This method recognizes the social environment in which explanation questions are asked, and may unify many different existing accounts.

It's *supposed* to be written in the form of analytic philosophy, but I won't pretend to have done that. Still, I think it's mostly correct.
